You can contribute to translate AllMyWallets on Zanata: https://translate.zanata.org/project/view/allmywallets

If you want to be responsible of a particular language (and in charge to validate translations), please open an
issue on the AllMyWallets repository.

When adding support for a new language, please add it to the `available.json` file in the current folder. Feel free to
ask for help in GitHub issues.
